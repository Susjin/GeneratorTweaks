TODO: Add power-sharing functionality
    Calculations checking:
        Verify each generator, and it's adjacent
        If rules are set, store valid generators in a table
    Radius checking:
        Check radius around generator from ModData DONE!
        If another generator found, add it to a table DONE!
        Do that to ALL generators in the world DONE!
    Share Power:
        Get valid generators from table
        Get average total power from all
        Set this average consumption to each one

adjacent == inside radius
Calculations needed:
To share power, the generator needs to be adjacent to the same as other generators
e.g. Generator A is adjacent to Generators B and C.
     Generator B is only adjacent to Generator A.
     Generator C is only adjacent to Generator A.
THIS MEANS THAT NO POWER WILL BE SHARED BETWEEN THEM
e.g. Generator A is adjacent to Generators B and C.
     Generator B is adjacent to Generator A and C.
     Generator C is only adjacent to Generator A and B.
THIS MEANS THAT POWER WILL BE SHARED BETWEEN THEM

Always set the power on activation DONE!
Add generators turned on to global ModData DONE!
Every minute check ModData to adjust generators DONE!
    If no generators exist, remove square from ModData DONE!
